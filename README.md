## Hardware Requirements

The following hardware is required to build this project:

- Arduino UNO or similar board
- L298N motor driver
- Two DC motors
- HC-05 Bluetooth module
- 9V battery
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Remote control (such as a smartphone with Bluetooth)

## Installation

To install the software, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/MAzewail/2WD-Robot-RC.git`
2. Connect the hardware components as shown in the diagram in the `docs` directory.
3. Upload the `2wd-robot-rc.ino` sketch to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
4. Install a Bluetooth terminal app on your remote control device.
5. Pair the HC-05 Bluetooth module with the remote control device.
6. Open the Bluetooth terminal app and connect to the HC-05 module.
7. Use the app to send commands to the robot.

## Usage

To use the robot, follow these steps:

1. Turn on the robot and the remote control device.
2. Open the Bluetooth terminal app and connect to the HC-05 module.
